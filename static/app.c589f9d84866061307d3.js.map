Our products are exported to all over the world with a full range of network security products, which covers MJPEG and H.264 cameras and they also gained good reputation for their high cost efficiency.</p> <p>HDHawk is committed to making security life more accessible and affordable. We go beyond just simply selling a range of products to our customers. We were founded on a core vision, to provide all residential and small business customers with a simple way to stay in control of what happens at their property and with their loved ones. This vision still affects everything we do today, and we believe that “the world in my eyes” is realizable and affordable for every individual or SME. </p> <p>We sincerely welcome worldwide partners to join us and expand HDHawk brand value together.</p> </div> <div class=hd-about-info-text-item> <h3>Founder Story</h3> <p>In 2001, the founder of HDHawk, Jack Lee, was abroad on holiday with his family when he received a notification that his burglar alarm had been triggered. He had no idea what was going on, and the automatic text message alert that he received from his alarm gave little clue.</p> <p>Not being able to contact his family or neighbours nearby to his property, Jack was left with no other choice but to phone the Police. Being so far away with no way of knowing what was happening was unbearable, and as the minutes rolled by he couldn't help but worry about what was happening. Was his house, and his possessions, safe? After about 45 minutes, the Police rang Jack – it was a false alarm. The relief was instant, but the time he had spent helplessly worrying about his house from over 1000 miles away stayed with him. Jack realised it was no good just being told there was a problem – he needed to see the problem (or at least see there wasn't a problem!). On his return he looked into what remote camera solutions were available in the market, but everything seemed far too technical or was ridiculously expensive. With the developments in mobile technology and the increase of internet speeds Jack thought that there must be an easier way. </p> <p>After 4 years of research and development, Jack created the HDHawk IP camera – designed from the start with non-technical users in mind, and in 2005 we were able to officially launch the HDHawk to the public.</p> </div> <div class=hd-about-info-text-item> <h3>HDHawk: The Company</h3> <p>HDHawk Solutions delivers simple and affordable products to help you keep an eye on your home and loved ones.

solution provider integrating R&D, manufacture and sales. We strive to provide high quality, competitive priced network video surveillance devices and professional services for worldwide clients. Our products are exported to all over the world with a full range of network security products, which covers MJPEG and H.264 cameras and they also gained good reputation for their high cost efficiency.</p> <p>HDHawk is committed to making security life more accessible and affordable. We go beyond just simply selling a range of products to our customers. We were founded on a core vision, to provide all residential and small business customers with a simple way to stay in control of what happens at their property and with their loved ones. This vision still affects everything we do today, and we believe that “the world in my eyes” is realizable and affordable for every individual or SME. </p> <p>We sincerely welcome worldwide partners to join us and expand HDHawk brand value together.</p> </div> <div class=hd-about-info-text-item> <h3>Founder Story</h3> <p>In 2001, the founder of HDHawk, Jack Lee, was abroad on holiday with his family when he received a notification that his burglar alarm had been triggered. He had no idea what was going on, and the automatic text message alert that he received from his alarm gave little clue.</p> <p>Not being able to contact his family or neighbours nearby to his property, Jack was left with no other choice but to phone the Police. Being so far away with no way of knowing what was happening was unbearable, and as the minutes rolled by he couldn't help but worry about what was happening. Was his house, and his possessions, safe? After about 45 minutes, the Police rang Jack – it was a false alarm. The relief was instant, but the time he had spent helplessly worrying about his house from over 1000 miles away stayed with him. Jack realised it was no good just being told there was a problem – he needed to see the problem (or at least see there wasn't a problem!). On his return he looked into what remote camera solutions were available in the market, but everything seemed far too technical or was ridiculously expensive. With the developments in mobile technology and the increase of internet speeds Jack thought that there must be an easier way. </p> <p>After 4 years of research and development, Jack created the HDHawk IP camera – designed from the start with non-technical users in mind, and in 2005 we were able to officially launch the HDHawk to the public.</p> </div> <div class=hd-about-info-text-item> <h3>HDHawk: The Company</h3> <p>HDHawk Solutions delivers simple and affordable products to help you keep an eye on your home and loved ones. We ensure that each individual member of the HDHawk team is aligned with our vision, and this helps fuel our constant improvement and innovation – making certain that every product we release reflects our goal to make the HDHawk range accessible to all residential and small business customers.</p> <p>HDHawk is not just about hardware. Our software is regularly updated, as is our firmware, which is constantly being developed with refinements and improvements. We believe heavily in inter-operability, an area in which we are pioneers, and all our products are PC and Mac compatible. </p> <p>As a dynamic team, we have the ability to react and respond quickly to market demand, doing away with inefficient large corporation bureaucracy. Our customers needs are our main focus, and we take great pride in our ongoing company initiative “the world in my eyes” where we maintain multiple channels of communication between ourselves and our customers. We listen to all customer feedback and criticism and believe that this is vital to us reaching our goal.</p> <p>These qualities are what makes HDHawk Solutions unique, and ultimately helps us to deliver improved products and solutions to our customers.</p> <p>The response this generates from customers is overwhelming.
